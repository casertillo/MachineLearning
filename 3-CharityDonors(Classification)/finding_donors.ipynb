    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "During the training phase, it can be seen that RF outperformed SVM and KNN reaching almost 1 for the both metrics and with any dataset split. Then we observe that the KNN deliver the second best result with 0.9133 on accuracy and 0.8630 on  F-score, last the SVM with results below the KNN on accuracy and  F-score, 0.8766 and 0.8099 respectively. Additionally, we can see that the algorithm that took more time to train was the SVM with 271 seconds. Instead, RF and KNN had a significant difference lasting less than 3 seconds to train their models. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, during the testing phase with the 10% and 100% of the instances, the SVM revealed the best results in both metrics with values of 0.8632 for the accuracy and 0.7612 for the  F-score. KNN and RF had similar results below the SVM model in accuracy 0.8405 for RF and 0.8464 for KNN. A more visible difference on the  F-score can be seen RF reporting 0.6941, meanwhile, KNN had 0.7036. Regarding time, the SVM had a dramatic drop from 271 seconds to 37. KNN had a modest increase, meanwhile, RF remained steady. \n",

    "**1) sex**.- Based on national surveys this is always a key factor, unfortunately, women are more underpaid than their male counterpart.<br>\n",
    "**2) education-level**.- Besides sex, education level is a key factor since people with a bachelor or higher education level tend to get better jobs than people with just high school or lower degrees.<br>\n",
    "**3) occupation**.- I think that this one is also correlated with \"education-level\" because you could have a master degree, but if you are not working in a field related to that for better or worse that could impact your salary.<br>\n",
    "**4) age**.- Also an important variable, there is a clear salary range from recent graduates to seniors to retired people.<br>\n",
    "**5)race**.- Still a factor in many working places, there are races that are not visible or taken into account for many industries. Or specific races are selected for specific types of work.<br>\n",
    "**6)native-country**.- Related to the 5th variable, but I think that less important because it might be you are from Mexico or Brazil, but if you look like \"white\" maybe you get a better job. It is hard to say it and perhaps little racist, but the reality in many jobs is that.<br> \n",
    "**7)hours-per-week**.- It might be possible that people that work more than 40 hours are considered working class and then earn less than \\$50k. Or contrary, people that work more, earn more. Still, I do not think is strong enough to classify correctly.<br>\n",
    "**8)workclass**.- I do not think that could have any impact. Maybe a worker in a private sector earns more or less than one in the public sector. It might work for positions within the same sector, but in this case I do not think helps to improve.<br>\n",
    "**9)education-num**.- This variable could have been important if the variable \"education-level\" would not be available. However, and as a disadvantage this variable is continuous and for this case, I believe the \"education-level\" is better since provides more concise information and less spreaded.\n",
    "**10)capital-gain**.- I think that this variable with \"capital-loss\" does not contribute to the correctly classification, it can be any number and change any time.<br>\n",
    "**11)capital-loss**.- same as the variable number 10.<br>\n",
    "**12)relationship**.- This one with \"marital-status\" in reallity does not impact wheather a person earn more or less money. You can be single or with a couple earning the same money.<br>\n",
    "**13)marital-status**.- The same as variable 12. This could have been important if in case of just asking the marital status, ask the age that you got married. Probably people that got married early have more difficult to change jobs and hence increase their salaries.<br>\n"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
