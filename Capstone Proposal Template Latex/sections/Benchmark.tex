\section{Benchmark}

Based on the literature found, the techniques that can be implemented with reliable results are 3: Decision trees regression, linear regression, and recurrent neural networks(RNN). Besides this supervised learning algorithms, I would like to try support vector regressions(SVR). These models have to be compared based on the evaluation metric, which is the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error(RMSLE), explained in the next section.
